1. We need any functions that take ScanIn to return an input invalid status.
Functions that may require multiple inputs must have multiple return types or status.
Perhaps use an enum or class to return, for every function...

Player Draws card
Player discards card
ALl players check for possible interrupt
All players decide whether to interrupt

If interrupt: new player takes discarded tile. Then discards tile
Else: next player draws tile (repeat above)
